# scc-pi  

This is a GitHub organisation for performance and intelligence at Sheffield City Council. 

Currently, the [organisation members](https://github.com/orgs/scc-pi/people) are from the Performance & Intelligence team. Other people with a performance and intelligence, data analysis, role with the Council could become a member.  

If you're interested in becoming a member please contact Laurie Platt. However, you need to be aware of data protection considerations and that we could switch to an alternative Git-based repository product such as BitBucket: [scc-pi.github.io/pinsheff/github.html#github-1](https://scc-pi.github.io/pinsheff/github.html#github-1). Only two or three members are actively using this GitHub organisation and we're yet to use it to properly collaborate on a repository.
