This is a GitHub organisation for performance and intelligence at Sheffield City Council. Currently, the [organisation members](https://github.com/orgs/scc-pi/people) are from the Performance & Intelligence team. Hopefully other people with a performance and intelligence, data analysis, role with the Council will be able to join. However, we first need to discuss and agree our use of GitHub with the Council's IT Officers. 

When using GitHub you need to be aware of data protection considerations: [scc-pi.github.io/pinsheff/github.html#github-1](https://scc-pi.github.io/pinsheff/github.html#github-1).
